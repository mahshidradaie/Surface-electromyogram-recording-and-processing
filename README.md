This project focuses on the analysis and processing of surface electromyogram signals to study the behavior of the neuromuscular system in the hand and wrist. The goal was to understand how various muscles coordinate to produce complex arm movements.
1. Data Acquisition and Initial Analysis:
I conducted an experiment to record sEMG signals from the forearm and wrist muscles during different motor tasks. The data was analyzed and visualized using LabChart to observe muscle activation patterns and overall signal behavior.
2. Signal Preprocessing:
The raw EMG signals were imported into EMGLAB, where they were filtered to remove noise and artifacts. I extracted key statistical features such as signal amplitude and variance for further analysis.
3. Data Preparation and Classification:
The preprocessed data was divided into training and testing sets, followed by channel normalization to ensure consistency across inputs. I applied machine learning algorithms, including Support Vector Machine (SVM) and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), to classify muscle activity patterns.
4. Performance Evaluation:
I implemented the classification models in MATLAB and evaluated their performance using a confusion matrix, allowing for analysis of accuracy and classification effectiveness.
